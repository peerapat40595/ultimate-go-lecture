# Productivity Versus Performance

## Go

1. Fast
2. Concurrency

## Does performance matters

Actually, productivity is our number one priority

Cost trade off between productivity and performance

But Go is changing that

Go is helping us take advantage of the hardware but we have to learn how to do it.

It's not magic, we still have to learn our design, our guidelines, our principles, the way to do things.

Power and expressiveness

The language itself is not enough, it is a tool.

We have to develop, we have to develop sound software engineering practices, we must have sedigning guidelines in these things.

Together with that and Go, we can write software that's

- reliable
- integrity
- readable
- can change legacy
