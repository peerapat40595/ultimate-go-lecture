# Prepare your mind

SW -> about designing and architecting

about making choices

large layers of abstraction -> write code to deal with future, deal with change -> This is bad

We don't need abstraction layers to decouple

hardware is a platform -> execution -> determines how our programs

Rudy Java -> VM

GO -> real machine -> know how it's gonna run on that machine -> have some indication, expectation

Every decision we make come with a `cost`

no more throwing hardware problem

Refactor

Prototyping

`Technology changes quickly but our minds change so slowly
